# djangoql

Unfold provides out-of-the-box support for the djangoql package by applying custom styles to its search input, toggle checkbox, and dropdown components. No additional configuration or changes to your `settings.py` file are required to enable this integration—simply ensure Unfold is installed and activated in your Django project.

- Only the default admin djangoql search UI receives Unfold styling for a consistent look and feel.
- Custom pages generated by djangoql (such as embedded documentation pages) are not styled by Unfold.
- Unfold also removes the "help" link to djangoql’s documentation page via CSS for a cleaner user interface.

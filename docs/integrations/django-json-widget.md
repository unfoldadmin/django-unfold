# Django JSON Widget

To use Django JSON Widget with Unfold, simply follow the [official installation instructions](https://pypi.org/project/django-json-widget/). No additional configuration or changes to your `INSTALLED_APPS` are necessary, Unfold will style the widget automatically.

The Unfold integration enhances the default Django JSON Widget by providing improved dark mode support and ensuring a modern, cohesive appearance in the admin. Integration is seamless: Unfold applies custom CSS to override the widget’s default styles, so everything works out of the box once both packages (`unfold` and `django-json-widget`) are installed.

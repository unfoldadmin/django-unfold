# django-guardian

Adding support for django-guardian is quite straightforward in Unfold, just add `unfold.contrib.guardian` to `INSTALLED_APPS` at the beginning of the file. This action will override all templates coming from the django-guardian. Please note that **Object permissions** link is available in top right dropdown navigation.
